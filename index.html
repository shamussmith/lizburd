<p>
 Kathy Land (2020 IEEE President-Elect)
</p>
<p>
"It is an honor to endorse Liz. She is a true leader. Having served as in past executive Computer Society (CS) Roles, as well as a Division Director for the IEEE CS she knows the CS and IEEE inside and out. She is open and trustworthy, engaging and accessible, plus - I have the utmost confidence that Liz will use her tenacity, desire for change, and understanding of the IEEE's political landscape to make a difference. I have worked with Liz since 2010, when we both sat on the CS Board of Governors. Liz is an independent thinker, a doer, a dedicated volunteer with IEEE's best interest at heart, and someone whose advice and counsel I often seek. She is certainly not afraid of doing the work required to help IEEE improve. She is an inspiration, has my highest possible recommendation. If elected, she will serve IEEE and its membership with distinction."

						<h2>POSITION STATEMENT</h2>
					</header>
                            <p>
As the world comes to grips with the impact of COVID-19, and for Region 10 adverse weather events including cyclone and bushfires it would be easy to question the relevance of professional organisations. It has become clear that professional associations are being disrupted; the "open" community challenges the way we present and consume information. For instance, the internet has changed the nature of education; no longer is there limited access to learning resources. Now, the challenge is information is so plentiful it’s difficult to identify the quality and reliability of that information. Similar are the challenges with research publications. Approaches IEEE once used to raise revenue are being replaced with new cheaper, more agile players and a host of low-quality competitors. The IEEE has been slow to respond, so we need to act quickly else we will be left behind. If elected I will use this opportunity to get the IEEE to consider how these technologies can be used for the strategic advantage of its members, Societies and generally for its own advancement.
</p>
 <p>
Yet, and perhaps because of the crises we faced in 2020, I see a strong future for professional societies. Now, more clearly than ever, we value community and technological innovation. Our scientific international and inter-disciplinary communities will help us navigate these most difficult times. The IEEE and especially the Computer Society has the power to make a difference. The strength of the IEEE is therefore in its Societies, events and networks but the ‘value add’ that these provide is not truly realized, or in fact in many cases, appreciated. The Computer Society has recently led the way in defining new membership models. However, while shaping personalized membership is an important step forward, collaboration across individual Societies and other similar professional association is an important next step to truly support inter- and transdisciplinary cooperation.
</p>
<p>
We, the members, want value for money and access to relevant, high quality materials that are appropriate to our fields of interest that will help us to develop our careers and make a difference in society. One important move I believe the IEEE should take, is to better exploit the commonality of interest across its relevant groups. Such collaboration, to benefit members, is something that I will strongly champion using my experience and existing networks. 
</p>
<p>
If elected, I will help the IEEE transition to new modes of working, to better recognise the achievements of all members and to facilitate new networking opportunities to support multi-disciplinary and international engagement for local and global community building.
</p>
 
<p>
Through my extensive interaction across the regions I am aware that the needs of communities worldwide differ. I believe we must do more to support Regional variation. If elected, I will promote more effective ways to support localised professional development. Also I explore more effective ways for members to engage with the IEEE - worldwide, and enable more networking opportunities to support industry, academic, and interdisciplinary partnerships with local and international community building.
</p>
<p>
Thus, through this role I intend to demonstrate the value of Societies and help the IEEE capitalise on its strengths so that the value of membership is clearly evident to all.

					<h2>IEEE ACTIVITIES</h2>
							</header>
<p> Liz has been an active IEEE volunteer since the time she was a PhD student. Her contributions have covered most areas of the IEEE, including conferences, journals, education and local engagement for sections in Region 8 and 10. Her most recent work is via her joint leadership of one of two 2020 President Ad Hoc working groups. This working group called the ‘Pipeline project’ is examining ways in which volunteers can be better recognised for their contributions and to find more effective ways of encouraging new volunteers into the organization. Liz is also chair of the IEEE Audit Committee.
